                    William Shakespeare was born in April 1564 in the town of Stratford-upon-Avon, on England’s Avon River. When he was eighteen, he married Anne Hathaway. The couple had three children—an older daughter Susanna and twins, Judith and Hamnet. Hamnet, Shakespeare’s
                    only son, died in childhood. The bulk of Shakespeare’s working life was spent in the theater world of London, where he established himself professionally by the early 1590s. He enjoyed success not only as a playwright and poet, but
                    also as an actor and shareholder in an acting company. Although some think that sometime between 1610 and 1613 Shakespeare retired from the theater and returned home to Stratford, where he died in 1616, others believe that he may have
                    continued to work in London until close to his death. </h3>

                <h1>Merchent of Venice</h1>
                <p>
                    The Merchant of Venice is a 16th-century play written by William Shakespeare. Set in Venice, the play follows the story of Antonio, a merchant, and his friend Bassanio, who is seeking to win the hand of Portia, a wealthy heiress. Antonio is unable to
                    secure the funds himself, so he turns to Shylock, a Jewish moneylender, who agrees to grant him a loan on the condition that if Antonio fails to repay it, he will be forced to forfeit a pound of his flesh. Despite the danger of his
                    predicament, Antonio pleads with Shylock to have mercy, and Portia is able to save Antonio by inferring a loophole in Shylock's agreement. The play is notable for its exploration of themes of justice, mercy, and prejudice.</p>
